PupSpa Project
## Introduction
A simple web page to let customers know about PupSpa services.

## REQUIREMENT
Let’s practice what we’ve just learned about CSS Grid through building a classic, grid-based, responsive web page. Your friend has just opened a doggie daycare and grooming services shop, PupSpa. They would like a simple web page to let customers know about their services.

We currently have an HTML document styled with CSS, but every <div> appears in its own row. Let’s add some CSS grid properties to make parts of the site appear more cohesive.
